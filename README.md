# Employee Turnover Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aimed to analyze and predict employee turnover at Salifort Motors using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal was to provide insights into the factors driving employee turnover and develop a predictive model to help Salifort Motors reduce turnover rates and improve employee retention.

### Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast whether an employee is likely to leave the company. By identifying potential turnover risks, Salifort Motors can take proactive measures to address employee concerns and improve retention rates.

### Tasks Done

- Conducted data analysis on survey data provided by Salifort Motors to understand the factors contributing to employee turnover.
- Explored various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost, to identify the most effective approach for predicting employee departure.
- Compared the performance of different models and selected the random forest model as the most effective for predicting employee turnover based on the provided dataset.

### Results

- The random forest model outperformed the decision tree model, demonstrating slightly higher accuracy in predicting employee turnover.
